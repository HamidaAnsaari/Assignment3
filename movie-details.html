    <h><strong>The Book of Clarence</strong></h>
    <p>The Book of Clarence is a comedy-drama set in 33 A.D., at the tail end of the ministry of Jesus Christ. The film follows the exploits of Clarence, a Hebrew man who struggles to survive in the increasingly dangerous province of Judea under the Roman occupation. However, through his encounters with Jesus and the Twelve Disciples, Clarence begins to learn a lesson about faith.
    While The Book of Clarence didn't do much business at the box office, the film excels in its surprisingly deep exploration of faith. Bolstered by terrific performances from LaKeith Stanfield, Omar Sy, and Alfre Woodard, The Book of Clarence is an intriguing exploration into how the life of a regular person may have been affected by the ministry of Jesus. The depth and drama of this film is enough to earn it a spot on the list, but there are several others in theaters now that are even better than The Book of Clarence...</p>
